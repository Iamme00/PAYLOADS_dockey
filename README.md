They are the payloads for the rubber ducker.Whether it "works" or not depends on the specific context and target system.
Before attempting to use such scripts, it's important to:
1)Ensure you have the legal right and authorization to test or interact with the target system.
2)Understand and respect the terms of service of the platforms you are interacting with.
3)Test on your own devices or systems or seek explicit permission from others when testing on theirs.
